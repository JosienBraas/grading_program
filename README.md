Exercise source: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/  
Requires:
- variables, data types, and numerical operators
- basic input/output
- logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that allows the user to enter the grade scored in a programming class (0-100). If the user scored a 100 then notify the user that they got a perfect score.

1. Modify the program so that if the user scored a 90-100 it informs the user that they scored an A
2. Modify the program so that it will notify the user of their letter grade
0-59 F 60-69 D 70-79 C 80-89 B 90-100 A

### Cola Machine
Exercise source: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/  
Requires:
- variables, data types, and numerical operators
- basic input/output
- logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever). Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5. Output which beverage they chose.

1. If you program uses if statements instead of a switch statement, modify it to use a switch statement.
If instead your program uses a switch statement, modify it to use if/else-if statements.
2. Modify the program so that if the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."
