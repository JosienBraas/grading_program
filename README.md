# Python Exercises
Some practice exercises in Python.

### Grading Program
Exercise source: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/  
Requires:
- variables, data types, and numerical operators
- basic input/output
- logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that allows the user to enter the grade scored in a programming class (0-100). If the user scored a 100 then notify the user that they got a perfect score.

1. Modify the program so that if the user scored a 90-100 it informs the user that they scored an A
2. Modify the program so that it will notify the user of their letter grade
0-59 F 60-69 D 70-79 C 80-89 B 90-100 A

### Cola Machine
Exercise source: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/  
Requires:
- variables, data types, and numerical operators
- basic input/output
- logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever). Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5. Output which beverage they chose.

1. If you program uses if statements instead of a switch statement, modify it to use a switch statement.
If instead your program uses a switch statement, modify it to use if/else-if statements.
2. Modify the program so that if the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."

### While( user == gullible )
Exercise source: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/  
Requires:
- variables, data types, and numerical operators
- basic input/output
- logic (if statements, switch statements)
- loops (for, while, do-while)

Write a program that ccontinues to asks the user to enter any number other than 5 until the user enters the number 5. Then tell the user "Hey! You weren't supposed to enter 5!" and exit the program.

1. Modify the program so that after 10 iterations if the user still hasn't entered 5 will tell the user "Wow, you're more patient than I am, you win." and exit.

2. Modify the program so that it asks the user to enter any number other than the number equal to the number of times they've been asked to enter a number. (i.e on the first iteration "Please enter any number other than 0" and on the second iteration "Please enter any number other than 1" etc. etc. The program must behave accordingly exiting when the user enters the number they were asked not to.)
